# Gene_Sequence_Analyzer

Explanation of the Code:
1. Gene Database: A dictionary containing sample gene sequences with associated
genes, mutations, and disorders.
2. Validation Function: is_valid_dna checks if the input DNA sequence is valid.
3. Error Handling: show_error displays an error message if the DNA sequence is invalid.
4. GC Content Calculation: calculate_gc_content calculates the GC content of the DNA
sequence.
5. DNA to RNA Transcription: transcribe_dna_to_rna transcribes the DNA sequence to its
corresponding RNA sequence.
6. Genetic Disorder Detection: detect_genetic_disorders checks if the DNA sequence
contains any known gene mutations associated with genetic disorders.
7. Clear Function: clear_all clears the input and result fields.
8. GUI Creation: create_gui sets up the graphical user interface using Tkinter.

Conclusion:
The Gene Sequence Analyzer provides a comprehensive tool for analyzing DNA sequences,
calculating GC content, transcribing DNA to RNA, and detecting genetic disorders. By
integrating advanced computational techniques with a user-friendly interface, it enables users
to gain valuable insights into their genetic information, supporting research and personalized
medicine initiatives.
This report serves as an overview of the Gene Sequence Analyzer's functionalities and its
underlying computational methods, highlighting its potential applications in the fields of
